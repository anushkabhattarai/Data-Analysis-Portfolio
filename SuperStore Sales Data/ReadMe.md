# Power BI Sales Dashboard & Forecasting Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building an interactive and insightful sales dashboard using Power BI. The data was sourced from an ecommerce store operating across India. The main goal was to analyze sales performance, generate actionable insights, and apply time series analysis to forecast future sales trends.

The dashboard includes multiple visual elements such as KPIs, bar charts, line charts, maps, and donut charts to give business stakeholders a complete view of sales performance across regions, product categories, time periods, and customer segments.

## Forecasting and Time Series Analysis

Time series forecasting was applied to the historical sales data to project future sales over a 15-day period. The model used built-in Power BI analytics capabilities to generate and visualize short-term sales forecasts. This provided useful insights for inventory planning and marketing strategy.

## Key Insights

1. **Category Performance**: Office Supplies is the leading category in terms of revenue, followed by Technology and Furniture. Sub-category analysis shows Phones and Chairs as top-performing products.

2. **Regional Trends**: States like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu show the highest profit margins. The business can explore opportunities in other underperforming regions.

3. **Customer Segments**: Consumers contribute the highest percentage of sales, making them a key target for future campaigns. Corporate and Home Office segments also show notable performance.

4. **Payment Mode Analysis**: Cash on Delivery (COD) is still the most preferred mode of payment, suggesting the need to build trust for digital payment methods.

5. **Seasonality**: Sales peak during the last quarter of the year, especially from October to December, indicating seasonal buying behavior.

6. **Operational Efficiency**: The average delivery time is 4 days, which is relatively efficient but may be optimized further based on region-specific analysis.

7. **Sales Forecasting**: Based on historical patterns, the forecast suggests consistent sales trends over the next two weeks, helping the business in planning inventory and promotions.
