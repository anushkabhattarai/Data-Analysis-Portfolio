# Video Game Character Relational Database Project

## Project Description

This project is a relational database built using PostgreSQL that stores and manages information about video game characters. It covers fundamental concepts of relational database design, including creating tables, defining relationships between tables, inserting data, and querying data.

The project helped me learn how to:

- Design database schemas with multiple related tables.
- Implement primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure data integrity.
- Model one-to-one and many-to-many relationships using SQL.
- Write SQL queries to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data.
- Use JOIN operations to combine data from related tables.
